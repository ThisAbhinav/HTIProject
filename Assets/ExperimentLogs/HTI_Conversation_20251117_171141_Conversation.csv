1,8.34,"Alex how are you","Hey! I'm doing really well, thanks for asking! I'm Alex, and I'm currently in the middle of junior year here at UC Berkeley, which means I'm constantly juggling CS classes, TA duties for an intro programming course, and trying to stay caffeinated. It's actually really cool to connect with someone studying abroad; I'm always interested in cultural exchange, especially when it comes to university life.",14.50,"VisualCueText",0.50,8.84,4.06,False
2,63.89,"Alex who is your roommate and what is your favorite weekend activity","Oh, my roommate's name is Jake. He’s studying Mechanical Engineering, so our side of the dorm room is usually a mix of my coding textbooks and his gears and prototypes—it’s an interesting blend of chaos! We're lucky to live right on campus, which makes everything super convenient, though the dining hall food gets old sometimes. As for weekends, my absolute favorite thing is grabbing some friends and hitting the hiking trails right behind the campus.",15.48,"VisualCueText",0.50,64.39,3.52,False
